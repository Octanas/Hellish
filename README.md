# Hellish

***Hellish*** is a single-player hack and slash platformer that gives the player control of Akira, a skilled demon slayer swordsman who dedicated his whole life to ridding the world of hell beasts. 

When going against his greatest foe yet, Akira is defeated and transported to his enemies' home realm; but he won't go down easily.

1. Clone (or pull) the project
2. Get the FMOD integration package from the Asset Store
3. Import the package to the project using Unity's Package Manager
4. In the FMOD's integration package manager, select `Single Platform Build` and set the build path to `/FMODAssets/Desktop/`
5. Reset the project: `git reset --hard` (this step is done because what was added is not meant to be pushed to the repo, it will be used only locally)
